RemotePageNext
====
Custom page component for editing remote Next.js SPA within AEM. This component fetches all the necessary assets from the application's generated asset-manifest.json and uses this for rendering the SPA within AEM.


## Requirements

### Create and expose an asset-manifest.json file
In a React app, running `npm run build` generates an `asset-manifest.json` file using the [webpack-manifest-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-manifest-plugin) which will contain the paths of all generated assets.
Using a similar approach, we need to add the necessary configs in the Next.js app to output a similar asset-manifest.json file. This file can then be used by AEM  to fetch the required scripts or styles for rendering the remote application.
Here we are using the [next-assets-manifest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-assets-manifest) package to generate the asset-manifest file in the Next.js app and transforming it to have a similar structure as the React version.

- `npm install next.config.js`
- If not available already, create a new file `next.config.js` in the project root.
- In this, add the following snippet.

```javascript
const withAssetsManifest = require('next-assets-manifest');

module.exports = withAssetsManifest({
    assetsManifest: {
        output: "../public/asset-manifest.json",
        transform: (assets, manifest) => {
            const entrypoints = [];
            for (let file in assets) {
                if(assets[file].endsWith(".js") || assets[file].endsWith(".css")) {
                    entrypoints.push(assets[file]);
                }
            }
            return {
                files: assets,
                entrypoints: entrypoints
            };
        }
    }
});
```

### Create an endpoint to fetch the app's initial data
A Next.js app does initial data population for a page using data props set in the page's DOM. For remotely loading the app inside AEM, we need to fetch this data and set it in the AEM RemotePageNext component.
- ```npm install xmldom ```
- Create `/pages/api/getNextProps.js`
- Add the following snippet in it:

```javascript
const { DOMParser } = require('xmldom');
const { NEXT_PUBLIC_URL} = process.env;

export default function handler(req, res) {
    let { path } = req.query;

    fetch(NEXT_PUBLIC_URL + (path || ''))
    .then(t => t.text())
    .then(t => {
        const parser = new DOMParser();
        const doc = parser.parseFromString(t, 'text/html');
        const data = doc.getElementById("__NEXT_DATA__").textContent;
        res.status(200).json(data);
    });
}
```
where `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` is the origin of the Next.js app to be edited.
_Note: Please ensure CORS configuration as detailed in the next step has been done to allow the AEM instance to be able to fetch this data._

### Enable CORS in Developement
Since AEM needs to fetch the data props of the Next.js app hosted on a different domain, we need to enable CORS in the application.This can be done adding the necessary response header using the `next.config.js` file

A simple implementation is as follows-
- Add the following content in the `next.config.js` file created during the [asset-manifest step](#create-and-expose-an-asset-manifest.json-file)

```javascript
const { NEXT_PUBLIC_AEM_HOST_URI } = process.env;

module.exports = withAssetsManifest({
    async headers() {
        return [
            {
                source: '/api/getNextProps',
                headers: [{
                    key: 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin',
                    value: NEXT_PUBLIC_AEM_HOST_URI
                }],
            },
        ]
    }
    ...
})
```
where `NEXT_PUBLIC_AEM_HOST_URI` is the origin of the AEM instance in which the remote SPA will be edited(_eg: http://localhost:4502_). To allow all origins, you can give "*" as the value as well.


### Configure remote URL
The remote application's URL can be set via the Page Properties, which is then written to JCR for this RemotePageNext component. The property defined for this is `./remoteSPAUrl`
The URL to be provided is the URL of the specific Next.js page to be edited. In most cases, this would be the host URL of the application.
For eg:  for editing a remote Next.js page at `https://test.com/abc`, this same URL needs to be provided in AEM as well.

### Displaying images in AEM
When using the [Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) component provided by `next/image`, the image `src` is usually provided as a relative path to the image within the project.To load the image in AEM, the URL needs to be absolute. For this we can use the `loader` prop provided by `next/image`.

A sample implementation of an Image component using absolute URL is as follows -

```javascript
import Image from 'next/image';
const { NEXT_PUBLIC_URL } = process.env;

const myLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {
    return `${NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`
}

export default function Test({...}) {
    return (
        <Image
            loader={myLoader}
            src="images/profile.jpg"
            height={108}
            width={108}
            alt={name} />
    );
}
```
where `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` is the origin of the Next.js app being edited.
